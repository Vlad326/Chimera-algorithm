# Chimera-algorithm

**Real-time computer vision system for combat robotics.** Detects enemies (YOLOv8-OBB) and self-locates (ArUco markers), then sends target data to the robot's microcontroller.

## What's here

1.Yolov8-OBB training programs.

2.Detection of yolov8-OBB.

3.Detection of 4 Arugo markers placed front, back, right, and left. Detection with processing of all variants, even when several markers are not detected.

4.Sending data to esp32 with checksum.

5.The main program for running real-time detection and sending to esp32

## What's not here

1.Datasets

2.Trained models

## How to download 

Main file is "main.py"

To download, you need to run the command in cmd "git clone https://github.com/Vlad326/Chimera-algorithm.git" in the desired folder or download ONLY this file.
